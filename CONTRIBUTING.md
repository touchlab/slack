## Requesting New Features and Reporting Bugs

Bugs and feature requests are tracked as issues in this repository.

Before opening a new issue:
* **check [the README](https://github.com/integrations/slack/blob/master/README.md)** to see if the behavior you observed might be expected and if configuration options are available to provide you with the desired behavior.
* **perform a cursory search** to see if there's [an existing issue](https://github.com/integrations/slack/issues) covering your feedback. If there is one and the issue is still open, **add a :+1: reaction** on the issue to express interest in the issue being resolved. That will help the team gauge interest without the noise of comments which trigger notifications to all watchers. Comments should be used only if you have new and useful information to share.
* **consider if you're giving feedback which involves sharing sensitive information** (e.g. the name of your private repository). If you're concerned about sharing such information in a public repository, please reach out via [GitHub Support](https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Re:+GitHub%2BSlack+Integration) instead to provide that feedback.

When opening an issue for a feature request:
* **use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **include as many details as possible in the body**. Explain your use-case, the problems you're hitting and the solutions you'd like to see to address those problems.

When opening an issue for a bug report, explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:
* **describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
* **provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

## Getting Started

This app is written in [ES6 JavaScript](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/) and runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). After cloning the repository, install the dependencies by running:

```
$ script/bootstrap
```

To run the app locally, you will need to configure a GitHub App and a Slack App.

#### Configuring a GitHub App

Following the [Probot docs for configuring up a GitHub App](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configure-a-github-app), with the only difference being these values for the GitHub App settings:

- **Webhook URL**: `https://DOMAIN/github/events`
- **Setup URL**: `https://DOMAIN/github/setup`

#### Configuring a Slack App

1. [Create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app_token=1). Note that this app uses the new [workspace token-based Slack app](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps-preview).

1. On the **Basic Information** tab, copy the values under the **App Credentials** section into `.env`.

1. Go to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab, click **Add a new Redirect URL** and enter `https://DOMAIN/slack/oauth/callback` and click **Save URLs**

1. Scroll down to **Select Permission Scopes**, add `links:read`, `links:write`, and `chat:write` and click **Save Changes**

1. Run `script/server` to start the server

1. On the **Event Subscriptions** tab, set **Request URL** to `https://DOMAIN/slack/events`, replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with the value that shows up when the server starts. Slack should show **Verified âœ“** if all is well.

1. Scroll down to **App Unfurl Domains**, click **Add Domain** and enter `github.com`

1. Click **Save Changes**

1. Go to `https://DOMAIN/` and click the **Add to Slack** button to install the app

1. Paste a GitHub.com url in your slack channel and watch the magic happen.

1. Go to the **Slash Commands** tab and click **Create New Command**:

    - **Command**: `/github`
    - **Request URL**: `https://DOMAIN/slack/command`
    - **Short Description**: `Subscribe to notifications for an Organization or Repository`
    - **Usage Hint**: `subscribe https://github.com/organization/repository`
    - Click **Save**
    - Test it out by typing `/github subscribe https://github.com/myorg/myrepo`

1. Congratulate yourself for following directions and clicking buttons. Take the rest of the day off because that was a lot of work.

## Submitting a pull request

0. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
0. Configure and install the dependencies: `script/bootstrap`
0. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `npm test`
0. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
0. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
0. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
0. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the [style guide][style].
